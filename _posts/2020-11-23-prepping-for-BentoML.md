title: Prepping for BentoML
published: true
---

Today was one of those days. Life called and I could not do any development.
I had a meeting with the podmate, with whom I am planning to work on BentoML.
We tried to make sense out of the issue on GitHub.

We realized that the issue we are currently working on emphasizes the
documentation. The main goal of the issue is to document how BentoML can be
used with data stored in Kafka. Developing additional APIs for Kafka
integration is a secondary goal.
I am not worried about the secondary goal as of now.

Thankfully, the issue mentioned a blog that describes how Kafka can be used
along with TensorFlow. While most of the things in the blog did not make much
sense to me, but now I have an overview of what we are expected to do.
