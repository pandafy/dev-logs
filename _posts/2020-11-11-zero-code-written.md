I didnâ€™t code anything today. To be honest, I only interacted with code while
helping others with their work.

I helped my Podmates with their assigned issues in Kiwi TCMS.
Most of the contributions we are doing right now does not make us think much.
We are just copy-pasting code from a different file, adapting it to our needs,
and calling it a new patch.
**The codebase itself is serving as our StackOverflow.**

While helping a Podmate, I tried the Live Server feature of VS Code.
I feel very retarded for not utilizing it for this long and using video calls
for sessions of pair programming. *What a noob!*

I helped a fellow contributor in OpenWISP with a tricky bug in his patch.
It was an easy catch, just needed to pay more attention to the error log.

In short, today was not a productive day.
