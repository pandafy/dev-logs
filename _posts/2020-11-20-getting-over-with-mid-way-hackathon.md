title: Getting Over with Mid-Way Hackathon
published: true
---

It was the last day of the hackathon and just like every hackathon I have ever
participated, there was a lot more work to do that there was time for.
The video calling with WebRTC was working but it was flaky.

When a user joins for the first time on the video call,
it is not able to connect to anyone. The user needed to join from another tab
to get connected. We blamed the servers we were using for this behavior,
but we don't know the exact reason for that.

Nonetheless, we got everything together. My teammates developed and integrated
the frontend after which the project looked anything but broken.
It felt alive and very usable.

We went to the last minute to record our demo video. It was a literal race
against time and the panic attack kicked in. Almost all of us were short of
breath. Just five minutes before the deadline for the hackathon, we
submitted our submission for the hackathon. The panic attack withdrew with
an adrenaline rush.

The Mid-Way Hackathon has been a rollercoaster ride.
We faced dead ends but we turned around and started over.

You never know, there can always be an opportunity to learn and I would very m
uch like to learn from you.

[Released openwisp-notifications 0.3.0](https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-notifications/pull/152)
and created a lot of mess. I bumped the version from 0.2.2  to 0.3.0 but did
not update the commit message. To make things worse, I added the git tag to the
wrong commit. I had to force push to the master branch a couple of times which
is not good.
