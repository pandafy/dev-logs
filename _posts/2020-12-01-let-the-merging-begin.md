title: Let the merging begin
published: true

I had a call scheduled for today regarding open work on OpenWISP with other
contributors. We decided to merge all open work which is near to completion
this week so we can progress with the development of the project.

I issued a minor release of openwisp-controller, i.e. 0.8.1 which is packed
with a small minor improvement to make the test suite independent of the
project settings. My heart always skips a beat whenever I have to publish a
package on PyPI. I am always afraid that I did something wrong and everything
got broken. Thankfully, it did not happen this time.

This release was a potential blocker to my work in ansible-openwisp2. After
publishing the release on PyPI I started to update my work on
ansible-openwisp2. Sadly, it did not go as planned and the ansible role was
stalling while installing openwisp-controller. This was not happening while
installing the openwisp-controller from the GitHub repository. Did I mess up
something in the release?

It was getting late and I could not think clearly due to drowsiness. I called
it off and decided to look into it tomorrow.

My team won the MLH Fellowship Midway Hackathon under the Best Community
Building Project category. I feel rewarded for the time and energy we put into
the development of the project.
