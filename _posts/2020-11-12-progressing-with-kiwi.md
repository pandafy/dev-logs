title: Progressing with Kiwi

Yesterday, [my first PR to Kiwi TCMS](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/2060)
got merged. The maintainer generously assigned me the next issue
I was hopping onto before.

Today was another day when I lost my code due to poor Git skills.
Now when I think about it, I believe it had nothing to do with my Git skills.
I guess I committed the code to another branch. Anyway, I started over from
the scratch. Luckily, the changes I made were not huge and there were no
gotchas in the previously written code. I was able to quickly redo the previous
work and add more code on top of it. I
[opened a PR for it](https://github.com/kiwitcms/Kiwi/pull/2088),
and I believe that this one will get merged swiftly.

I received a lot of praise from my Podmates for helping them with Kiwi.
I think of it as a rebate of the time which was gifted to me by ‘experts’
on [PySlackers](https://pyslackers.com/web).
The people who allowed me to pick their brains on niche Django
problems and the people who helped me develop rubber duck debugging skills.
I will be forever grateful to them.

The work on the OpenWISP’s side was silent. I didn’t do anything, but replied
to some emails. This festive weekend is killing my productivity.

### In other news

Being a Thursday, today was a show and tell. A podmate took an interesting
non-tech topic, mathemagic. After a long time, I had to use my brain to think
about something other than code. It was a fun activity and I did not perform
well. I will have to keep my mind sharp and stay focused.
