Being a Sunday, today I decided to take some rest from coding. I am trying to
strike a somewhat right balance between work and life.
In a way, my life has started to circle computers.
Answering questions like “What are your hobbies?” is getting hard for me and
I am not comfortable with this.

I replied to a few questions and suggestions on OpenWISP today. I did not do
anything significant but found out
[my PR for mitigating stall when celery broker is unreachable in OpenWISP Notifications](https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-notifications/pull/143)
is bogus. I will need to start fresh on this PR which I expect to be painful.

I also took up solving a bug in celery a few days ago.
I have not started with it yet. Maybe, I will start with it on Tuesday.
For tomorrow, I have planned to work on Kiwi TCMS.

I should stop running away from my commitments. I wonder whether it is possible to accept reality and keep running away from it. I believe it is, and I am doing it right now.
