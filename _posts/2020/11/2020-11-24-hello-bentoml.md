title: Hello BentoML!

I, along with my podmate researched a lot about Kafka integration for machine
learning models. Today, I learned many new things, or at least I learned many
new terms.

A huge shoutout to [Kai Waehner](https://www.kai-waehner.de/about/) for writing
such great blogs on Kafka integration with different machine learning libraries.
These blogs were helpful, but a rabbit hole. The blogs were highly intertwined.
We just kept following one after another. After some point in time,
we got fed up and called it.

We had our meeting with the maintainers of BentoML.
We tried to get our doubts resolved. The maintainers too did not have a
concrete idea for the implementation. They were very open ended and in
favor of exploring and supporting different implementations.

I woke up just 2 minutes before my standup meeting. I was half asleep during
the stand-up. But it went well. I kind of bailed from my work on OpenWISP
today. As new versions of OpenWISP modules are released, I needed to update
my PRs opened on ansible-openwisp2. But, I found out that there is already
a PR that should add support for the new version openwisp-controller and
it doesnâ€™t. So, I postponed my work until that PR is updated and merged.
