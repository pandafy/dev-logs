title: A day with Kiwi TCMS
published: true

As planned yesterday, I completed my pending PR on Kiwi TCMS.
Surprisingly, the maintainer had reviewed my PR again without me pushing any
changes.
As expected, I had made the same mistake which he had asked me not to avoid
in a previous review.
I am making the same mistakes that I used to do initially in OpenWISP.

I should give more time reviewing the PR myself.
I should pay more attention to the details.

I have started working on another issue but, I also need to make a PR for
adding commit guidelines in the contribution guidelines.
I hope to get both of them completed tomorrow.

I had almost an hour of discussion with my pod-mates that are also
contributing to Kiwi TCMS.
They were facing some problems with the assigned issues.
I hope I solved their doubts and pointed them in the right direction.
I am glad that my knowledge of Django could be of some use to others.
