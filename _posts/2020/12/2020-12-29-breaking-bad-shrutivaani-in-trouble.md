title: 'Breaking Bad: ShrutiVaani in trouble'

ShrutiVaani has become a total nightmare for us. It just ends up broken one way
or another.

I asked my teammate to record audio for a few syllables to make our audio
corpus more exhaustive. For some reason, there was a difference between her’s
setup and mine. My project setup was trashing at the syllabification of words.
It was breaking the rules of syllabification such that the generated syllables
were not making any sense. Hence, the audio generation library complained about
the lack of syllables in our audio corpus.

I spent more than an hour trying to fix the discrepancy in our setups. But at
last, I gave up. I just sent the changes to my teammate, and we will be using
her development setup for further testing of the project.

I played a long shot ask my teammate to share her virtual environment. But as
expected, it did not work on my system. I want this ShrutiVaani nightmare to
get over soon.
