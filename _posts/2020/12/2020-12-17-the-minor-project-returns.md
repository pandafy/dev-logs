title: The Minor Project Returns
published: true

The final leg of the minor project of my bachelor’s degree commenced in
December. I along with my peers are working on a project to develop a
text-to-speech application for the Sanskrit language.

We faced many hurdles along the journey and the most problematic one was the
time commitment. Anyhow, we managed to get through it and now we just need to
prepare a complete project report for it.

I spent my whole day developing a web application to host our TTS implementation
and make it something more than a console-based application. Meanwhile, my peers
worked on the project report. It requires writing an utter nonsense amount of
crap. I am glad, I am not in-charge of writing the report.

Today was the last standup of my MLH Fellowship. We had a retrospective of the
complete fellowship journey, played some games, and had fun.

I didn’t do any CTF challenges today. I lost my interest in the CTF since we got
stuck on one challenge
