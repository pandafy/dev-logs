title: Stuck with Kyverno
---

I took up a “good first issue” in Kyverno which was aimed to prevent logging
duplication. At first sight, it looked simple to me, but it’s been over two
weeks now and I haven’t made any progress with it. After banging my head trying
to debug it, I finally surrendered and asked maintainers for help. I can no
longer waste time by fiddling with Kyverno and not reaching anywhere.

This was my first attempt to contribute to a Kubernetes project. Moreover, my
brain is stuck at following the Pythonic approach which makes it even harder to
debug Kyverno written in GoLang.
