title: Subnet Subdivision Rule
---

I have been working on a new [feature of OpenWISP]()
for some time. While working on it, I got to know about some difficulties while
managing networks.

While working on this, most of my time was spent optimizing database queries.
The ease of Djangoâ€™s ORM sometimes makes you overlook the toll on the database.

A [PR is already a work in progress](https://github.com/openwisp/openwisp-controller/pull/402).
The core of this feature has been implemented. Now, I just need to add some
validation and tests to complete it.
