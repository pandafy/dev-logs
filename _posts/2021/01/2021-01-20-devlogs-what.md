title: "Devlogs: What?"
---

It's been quite a while since I wrote the last dev log. I was occupied with
academics and was not doing enough work with tech that I could write in the dev
log.

Sadly, I have not been done with academics yet. The university has postponed my
exams yet another time. The exams that were supposed to be held in December
will occur in the first week of February which destroys the next semester.

In between the practical examinations I worked on developing a custom dashboard
for OpenWISP. I was only able to pull through the practicals by working on this
simple issue.

I am thinking of writing a blog purely dedicated to the development of the
custom dashboard and decision making to avoid pitfalls. I have not published
my blog for installing OpenWRT on TP-Link Archer C50 yet. I will try to do it
soon.
