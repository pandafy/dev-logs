title: Semester Exam Begins
---

My semester exams kicked off today. The university has spread out the exams
across the month, thus ruining the whole month of January for me. The content
of devlogs will be a bit different these days. I will write about useful things
I find while preparing for exams.

Today I learned how DES, AES and RSA encryption works along with other
cryptography techniques.
