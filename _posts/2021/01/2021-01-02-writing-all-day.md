I spent all day on a text processor today. I completed my blog on Flashing
OpenWRT on TP-Link Archer C50. Then I worked on the project report on summer
training to be submitted in college.

Even GSoC evaluators find a blog post sufficient for validation of work.
But, our education system needs a 30-page long report for evaluation.
I am glad that I wrote the blog post for GSoC as a report so I could utilize
most of it.

I think I will spend tomorrow as well on a text processor. I will have to
create UML diagrams for OpenWISP Notifications which consume most of my time.
