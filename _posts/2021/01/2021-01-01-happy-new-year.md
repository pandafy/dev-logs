My TP-Link Archer C50 V4 got delivered on Christmas morning. I didn’t get
enough time to flash the router with OpenWRT. Also, I was afraid that I will
end up bricking the router if anything went wrong. This fear of mine further
delayed the flashing.

Today, I had an ample amount of time and I read sufficient documentation and
blogs on the subject and felt confident enough. I was able to successfully
flash the router with OpenWRT.

I started writing a blog today as a tutorial for flashing this router with
OpenWRT. I am just documenting everything in one place, so next time I won’t
need to go get answers from multiple searches on the internet.

Missed a test because I overslept. Thanks to the professor for allowing me to
retake that test. What an amazing start to a new year.
