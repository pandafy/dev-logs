title: "Summer Report: Day 2"
---

The prime goal for today was to complete the project report on summer training.

There was a dedicated section in the project skeleton for designing. So, I had
to create UML Diagrams for my project, i.e. OpenWISP Notifications. I decided
on creating a class diagram and sequence diagram since both of these would
have displayed the working of OpenWISP Notifications well.

I was about to create the class diagram by myself when I remembered that
Kiwi TCMS had something which automatically created the class diagram for its
models. It was the `graph_models` command of `django_extensions` module and it
created the class diagram far better than me.

With one UML diagram down, I had to create just one, i.e. the sequence diagram. W
ith some iterations, I was satisfied with the quality of the diagram.
It was depicting the interactions between different models well.
